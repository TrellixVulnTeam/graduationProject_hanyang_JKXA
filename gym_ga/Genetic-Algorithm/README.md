# Genetic-Algorithm
AI genetic algorithm able to solve an openAI Gym environment (LunarLander).<br>
<a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a> is a platform that provides environments to to test your AI algorithms.<br>
I used the LunarLander environment. After some generations, this genetic algorithm is able to land properly within the yellow flags.<br>
The learning rate is set to 0.0005 since if it was higher the learning would have been very unstable.
Here you can see the learning in 40 generations.
